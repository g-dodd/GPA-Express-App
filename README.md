# GPA Express Ap

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1. This project, when initialized, provides a web application that allows you to enter a student's first and last name, date of birth, and grade point average into a database. The entries of the database are provided to you in a table next to the form.

## Development server

Once you have cloned the project, you'll want to run `npm install` to install the package dependencies. Afterwards, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`. Currently, no end-to-end tests have been written at this time.
